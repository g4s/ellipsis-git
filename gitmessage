# This is a template file for gitmessage
# If you want to modify the template you can find it under ~/.gitmessage
# 
# The first line should include a strong headline
# and should not longer then 50 chars           #

# Rember the blank line between headline and body!
# For the body use a body-with of 72 chars                            #
# The body should include following content:
#  * why is the change necessary
#  * what affect has the change
#  * which side-effects are produced
#  * if provideable: ticket-number / -link

# If the commit is co-authored (e.g. during pair-programming)
# you should include the co-author.
# The right formation is:
#  * include at least one blank line between body and co-author
#  * for each author you should use a line formated like this
#    Co-authored-by: <name> - <author-email> or for github-user
#    Co-authored-by: <name> - <user@users.noreply.github.com>
